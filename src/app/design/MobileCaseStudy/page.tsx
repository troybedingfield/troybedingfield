                                <p>Our mobile app was originally built to match the minimally responsive web pages with all of the
                                    pages and products listed in the menu causing a very long and overwhelming experience for users
                                    to find what they need and make sense of where they need to go to access desired workflows. </p>
                                <p>We started by looking at analytics and user feedback on the most commonly used pages and
                                    functions and put pages into content type buckets so we coul rethink the menu and product pieces
                                    that the users cared about.</p>
                                <p>This also lead to us taking the mobile app and looking at keeping consistentcy with out brand
                                    and web app so that it doesn&apos;t feel like a different product but also update the functionality
                                    and design for a true mobile app experience.</p>

                            <p className="white">We created a submenu based on our pill button from the web app that would allow us
                                to filter our pages within each section and tabs within the page content to break content into
                                smaller sections to minimize vertical swiping.</p>

                    compaines and gathering data and relaying feedback as needed to both the UX and Development so we can
                    quickly turn around updates for further testing. The ease of use and paring down of pages and sections has
                    been a welcome change and the feedback has been this actually feels like a useful mobile application and not
                    a poor clone of the responsive mobile web app</p>
